# NoteBook-app-with-corona-SDK
A note taking app built with Corona SDK.

This app was built to teach myself mobile application development. Some of the skills I learned while working on it were querying a database using SQL, creating a frontend for the database via a ListView, and implementing user friendly tools to manipulate data.

Notes:

- Corona SDK does not provide a native mobile UI. A lot of work went into making a user friendly UI.

- There a lot of additional functionalties that can be added to the basic note app concept like automatically creating events from the body message.

- The biggest issue faced while developing this app was storing string data that contained apostrophes. The fix was to escape the apostrophe characters before saving the strings to the database.

- Since there are many note apps available, and the primary purpose was to teach myself programming, there is little to none active development on this app.

Compiling and Testing:

  - This app is built on Corona SDK, which can be downloaded at: https://coronalabs.com/
