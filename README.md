# NoteBook-app-with-corona-SDK
Creating a simple app that takes notes with corona SDK

Note: This was the first app I ever built!

This app is built for learning purposes, a notebook app is a good way to learn programming and mobile
application development beacuse the elements involved include: querying an SQL database, creating a frontend
for the database (ie. via listview), and implementing tools (user friendly tools) to manipulate data in the database

Notes:
-corona sdk does not provide us with native mobile UI, so a lot of work went into trying to make the UI
look usable

- Although the concept of a note-taking app is simple, there is alot of additional functionalities that can
be built on top of this concept (which can make this app very complex, ie. automatically creating events from body message).

- The biggest issue I faced was dealing with apostrophes when storing data, the fix was using escape characters
to format apostrophes

- There is very little motivation maintaining/working on this app since there are tonnes of note taking apps out there,
but it has been a great gateway app
